# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results 

When viewing the webpage initially you will see this page:

Use the filter search to input your criteria to find specific UFO sightings. Not all fields need to be filled in.

Once you input your desired filters, press enter or press outside the filter searchs and the webpage will filter the data.

## Summary

One drawback of this design

The biggest drawback to using this design is that everything is case-sensitive according to the data table. City names and states are often capitalized however in this design we must follow the format of the data table and so we must filter everything in lower-case.

Two recommendations for further development of would be

1. Remove the case-sensitivity 
2. Provide drop-down menus when pressing on the fiter search options
